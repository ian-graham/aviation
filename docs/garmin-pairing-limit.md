# Garmin GPS Device Pairing Limits
## TLDR
If you get the following error from a Garmin GPS when trying to pair with a new device:
```
Already connected with the maximum number of devices
```
The issue is simply that there are too many devices already *paired* with the GPS. You just need to unpair one to make room for the new one. 
## Some Background
This was something that I ran into briefly when working with one of the club Citabrias with a Garmin Aera 660 GPS. In retrospect, it was pretty obvious what was happening, but at the time I was confused because:
1. The GPS wasn't connected with *any* devices
2. There weren't enough devices already paired to make me suspect that we had actually run into a limit

Some time later, I had a few minutes to troubleshoot, and quickly realized that it was in fact a paired device limit that I was running into (apologies to the random pilot whose device I unpaired). Since googling `Already connected with the maximum number of devices` had turned up literally zero results, I figured that maybe putting this out there could save a few minutes of someone else's time.
